<h2>PREFACE.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span></h2>


<p>The examples of knitting, contained in the following pages, have been
selected with the greatest care,&mdash;many are original,&mdash;and the whole are
so arranged as to render them comprehensible even to a novice in the
art.</p>

<p>Knitting being so often sought, as an evening amusement, both by the
aged and by invalids, a large and distinct type has been adopted,&mdash;as
affording an additional facility. The writer feels confident in the
recommendation of "<span class="smcap">My Knitting Book</span>," and humbly hopes it may meet with
the same liberal reception that has been accorded to her "<span class="smcap">Hand-Book of
Needlework</span>."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span></p>

<p>The numerous piracies that have been committed on her last mentioned
work, have been one inducement to publish this little volume; and from
the low price at which it is fixed, nothing, but a very extended
circulation, can ensure her from loss. Some few of the examples have
been selected from the chapter on knitting, in the "<span class="smcap">Hand-Book</span>."</p>

<h2><a name="Explanation_of_Terms_used_in_Knitting" id="Explanation_of_Terms_used_in_Knitting"></a>Explanation of Terms used in Knitting.</h2>


<p><i>To cast on.</i>&mdash;The first interlacement of the cotton on the needle.</p>

<p><i>To cast off.</i>&mdash;To knit two stitches, and to pass the first over the
second, and so on to the last stitch, which is to be secured by drawing
the thread through.</p>

<p><i>To cast over.</i>&mdash;To bring the cotton forward round the needle.</p>

<p><i>To narrow.</i>&mdash;To lessen, by knitting two stitches together.</p>

<p><i>To seam.</i>&mdash;To knit a stitch with the cotton before the needle.</p>

<p><i>To widen.</i>&mdash;To increase by making a stitch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> bringing the cotton round
the needle, and knitting the same when it occurs.</p>

<p><i>A turn.</i>&mdash;Two rows in the same stitch, backwards and forwards.</p>

<p><i>To turn.</i>&mdash;To change the stitch.</p>

<p><i>To turn over.</i>&mdash;To bring the wool forward over the needle.</p>

<p><i>A row.</i>&mdash;The stitches from one end of the needle to the other.</p>

<p><i>A round.</i>&mdash;A row, when the stitches are on two, three, or more needles.</p>

<p><i>A plain row.</i>&mdash;That composed of simple knitting.</p>

<p><i>To pearl a row.</i>&mdash;To knit with the cotton before the needle.</p>

<p><i>To rib.</i>&mdash;To work alternate rows of plain and pearl knitting.</p>

<p><i>To bring the thread forward.</i>&mdash;To bring the cotton forward so as to
make an open stitch.</p>

<p><i>A loop stitch.</i>&mdash;Made by bringing the cotton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> before the needle, which,
in knitting the succeeding stitch, will again take its own place.</p>

<p><i>To slip or pass a stitch.</i>&mdash;To change it from one needle to the other
without knitting it.</p>

<p><i>To fasten on.</i>&mdash;The best way to fasten on is to place the two ends
contrariwise, and knit a few stitches with both together. For knitting,
with silk, or fine cotton, a <i>weaver's</i> knot will be found the best.</p>

<p><i>To take under.</i>&mdash;To pass the cotton from one needle to the other,
without changing its position.</p>

<p><i>Pearl, seam, and rib-stitch</i>&mdash;All signify the same.</p>

<p>N.B. The <i>sizes</i> of the <i>needles</i> are given according to the <i>Standard
FiliÃ¨re</i>.</p>

<p>It is necessary, in giving or following directions for knitting, to
caution knitters to observe a medium in their work&mdash;not knitting either
too loose or too tight.</p>

be repeated, alternately, until six stripes of each are worked. Then,&mdash;</p>

<p>Pick up seventy stitches in claret, on the right side, at one of the
narrow ends, and pearl one row. Repeat the six rows of white,&mdash;finishing
with the four rows of claret, and cast off.</p>

<p>Repeat the same at the other end of the cuff,&mdash;observing that the
knitting of the frill is to be on the wrong side.</p>

<p>The <i>Brioche</i> knitting-stitch is simply&mdash;bring the wool forward, slip
one; knit two together.</p>

<p>A Brioche is formed of sixteen straight narrow stripes, and sixteen wide
stripes, the latter <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>gradually decreasing in width towards the top or
centre of the cushion. It may be made in three-thread fleecy, or double
German wool, with ivory or wooden pins, No. 8.</p>

<p>Cast on ninety stitches, in black, for the narrow stripe; knit two
turns;&mdash;then, three turns in gold colour, and two turns again in black.
This completes the narrow stripe.</p>

<p>The conical stripe is knitted as follows:&mdash;bring the wool forward, knit
two together, twice, and turn; knit these two, and two more of the black
and turn; continue this,&mdash;taking each time two more stitches of the
black, until within two stitches of the top, and turn; the wool will now
be at the bottom or wide part of the stripe. Commence again with the
black, as in the former narrow stripe, knitting the two black stitches
at the top. It may be also as well to diminish the narrow stripes by
turning when within two stitches of the top, in the centre row of gold
colour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>By a <i>turn</i> is meant one row and back again.</p>

<p>The colours for the conical stripes may be any two or four colours,
which assort well together; or each may be different. When the last
conical stripe is finished, it is to be knitted to the first narrow
stripe.&mdash;The brioche is to be made up with a stiff bottom of mill board,
about eight inches in diameter, covered with cloth. The top is drawn
together, and fastened in the centre with a tuft of soft wool, or a cord
and tassels. It should be stuffed with down or fine combed wool.</p>

<p>The opening at the back must be sewn up; and a band, corresponding with
the plain knitting in front, is to be formed by raising fifty-six
stitches in pink, and knitting three plain rows, with the No. 18
needles. Then, with white, cast sixteen stitches on the same needle, and
knit seventy-two stitches; cast on sixteen stitches, and knit three rows
of eighty-eight stitches. In the next row,&mdash;bring the wool forward, knit

18 needles, knit one plain row. Then, with the large needles,&mdash;knit two
plain rows in white; two in pink; and four in white. Cast off.&mdash;This,
when sewn double, finishes the borders of the hood. It is to be drawn,
with ribbon, at the back and front.</p>

<p>A plain stitch at the beginning of each row, commonly called an <i>edge
stitch</i>, is a great improvement in most instances, as it makes an
uniform edge, and the pattern is kept more even at its commencement. In
most knitting, the edge-stitch is slipped.</p>

<p>It is easiest to learn to knit, by holding the wool over the fingers of
the left hand; the position of the hands is more graceful when thus
held.</p>

<p>It is always advisable to cast off loosely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>When it is requisite to cast off, and continue the row on a separate
needle, it is sometimes better to run a coarse silk through the cast off
stitches; they are easily taken up, when required, and the inconvenience
of the idle needle is avoided.</p>

<p>In knitting, when a pattern is spoken of, it means as many rows as form
the pattern.</p>

<p class="titlepage">CRITICAL NOTICES OF THE WORK.</p>

<p>"One of Mr. <span class="smcap">Murray's</span> series of Handbooks, which seem destined to embrace
all the arts of life as well as all the sights in the world. Miss
<span class="smcap">Lambert's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_aii" id="Page_aii">[ii]</a></span></span> treatise is one of practical utility, its information being
the product of experience: after sketching the history of needlework, it
proceeds to describe the various kinds of materials used, such as wool,
silk, gold thread, beads, &amp;c.; the canvas, patterns, frames, and
implements, required; the different kinds of stitches; the mode of
working certain patterns and shapes; the processes of embroidery,
knitting, and netting. The volume is very handsomely got up, and
illustrated profusely with wood-cuts; nothing seems wanting to its
completeness."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p>"We venture to recommend it as containing a great deal of practical
information respecting embroidery, frame work, knitting, netting,
braiding, bead work, and other profound mysteries, of which we, of the
uglier sex, know nothing.... We soon became interested in the historical
portion, which is gracefully and well written&mdash;so that the work is a
good book, instructive when the party consulting it desires instruction,
and amusing whenever she is weary of work. <span class="smcap">Miss Lambert</span> observes in her
Preface, that she has endeavoured, and we will add successfully, 'to
embrace those subjects which appeared most worthy of notice in a
Treatise on Decorative Needlework, and by combining a brief historical
sketch, with a detailed account of the practice of each department, to
render them more generally interesting than a mere manual of directions
and examples.'"&mdash;<i>AthenÃ¦um.</i></p>

<p>"This is the most curious, complete, and erudite treatise on the art of
needlework that has, probably, ever been compiled.... The variety,
fulness, and systematic arrangement of the book, not to say one word
about its numerous engravings, and the remarkably elegant style in which
it is 'gotten up,' demand unmixed applause."&mdash;<i>Atlas.</i></p>

<p>"A very elegant and useful work. The directions how to ply the needle
are plain and easy of comprehension, and the plates which accompany the
letterpress and illustrate the designs, will be found of great
assistance to the ready acquirement of the art and its numerous
principles. The ample instructions for drawing patterns, purchasing
implements, framing, and properly finishing work, will be found not the
least available portion of the book."&mdash;<i>Literary Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"An eminently practical work; clear in its explanation, precise in its
directions, natural in its arrangements. The style is simple and easy;
the collateral information abundant. Its value is enhanced by historical
notices,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_aiii" id="Page_aiii">[iii]</a></span> which have been prepared with judgment and knowledge, and are
not disfigured by the slightest affectation."&mdash;<i>Polytechnic Review.</i></p>

<p>"The first edition of <span class="smcap">Miss Lambert's 'Hand-book'</span> has been entirely sold
off, a better proof of its excellence than aught we could say in its
behalf; and a second edition has just appeared with an embossed cover,
which will render it an ornament to the drawing-room table, as well as
an object of utility from the nature of its contents. To this edition
several new patterns and engravings have been added, and additional
directions for crochet, knitting, netting, &amp;c."&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p>

<p>"The authoress seems to be thoroughly mistress of her craft, and has
produced not only a very instructive, but a very amusing volume upon a
branch of the fine arts now become again so fashionable.... A more
elegant or entertaining volume can scarcely be found on a drawing-room
table."&mdash;<i>Globe.</i></p>

<p>"This is a pleasant book, a good book, and a book worthy to be bought by
mothers and daughters, and studied, <i>con amore</i>, in quiet parlours and
snug nurseries. It is well produced. Its knowledge is practical, as a
few extracts, which may be of advantage to our readers, will best
show."&mdash;<i>Pictorial Times.</i></p>

<p>"Replete with excellent <i>practical</i> information, clear and concise rules
for acquiring a knowledge of all the varied branches of the art,
illustrated by a series of beautifully executed designs, representing
implements, patterns, material, and numerous articles of modern
fancy-work, eminently calculated to initiate the unlearned (aye, and
learned too) in all the mysteries of tent-stitch, embroideries, braid,
appliquÃ©, bead, chenille, canvas, and Berlin work, &amp;c. In short, the
work justifies its title; it possesses an elegant exterior, and we
prognosticate that few ladies will willingly dispense with so much
silent instruction."&mdash;<i>Sunday Times.</i></p>

<p>"The pretty volume now before us, has been compiled with exceeding care,
and strict attention to the most minute details; all is
well-arranged.... The illustrations are a valuable addition to the
interest and information of a volume which deserves a place on the table
of every lady."&mdash;<i>Art Union.</i></p>

<p>"A new and carefully revised edition of this very elegant work is here
presented to us, and we do not hesitate to assure our fair readers, that
they will find it highly deserving of a place on the boudoir and
drawing-room tables. The volume, we should premise, is exclusively
devoted to ornamental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_aiv" id="Page_aiv">[iv]</a></span> needlework, and will be found as interesting as
it is useful, for, in addition to very clear and accurate instructions
for acquiring a proficiency in every branch of the art, it contains an
historical notice of its cultivation from the earliest ages."&mdash;<i>Court
Journal.</i></p>

<p>"This '<span class="smcap">Hand-book</span>' cannot fail to assist the best taste; <i>utile et dulce</i>
have been carefully blended, and the descriptive letter-press has
evidently been given by a well-informed mind."&mdash;<i>Court Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"This elegantly printed volume contains a complete encyclopÃ¦dia of
information for the fair votaries of the needle. The various mysteries
of tapestry work, embroidery-work, and so forth, are fully laid open,
with a clearness of statement, and completeness of direction, which
leave nothing to desire."&mdash;<i>Illustrated London News.</i></p>
